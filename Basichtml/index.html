    <h1>Ice-Cream</h1>
    <p>We Value Your Frozen Cravings</p>

    <p>Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and <i>liquid nitrogen together</i>. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers.</p>
    
    <p>The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures <b>(below 2 °C or 35 °F)</b>. It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>

    <p>The origins of frozen desserts are obscure although several accounts exist about their history. Some sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BCE while others claim that the Roman Emperor Nero had ice collected from the Apennine Mountains to produce the first sorbet mixed with honey and wine. </p>

    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>Its spread throughout Europe is sometimes attributed to Arab traders, but more often to Marco Polo. Though it's not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after learning of it during his travels to China. The Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici is said to have introduced flavored sorbet ices to France when she brought some Italian chefs with her to France upon marrying the Duke of Orléans (Henry II of France) in 1533. One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the "frozen snow" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative. There is no evidence to support any of these legends.</p>
    <p>Snow was used to cool drinks in Greece around 500 BC and Hippocrates is known to have criticized chilled drinks for causing <i>"fluxes of the stomach".</i><font color="#C70039">Snow collected from the lower slopes of mountains was unsanitary and iced drinks were believed to cause convulsions, colic and a host of other ailments.</font> Seneca criticized the extravagant costs associated with iced desserts in an era without refrigeration.</p>
    <p>Despite this, ice and snow were prized ingredients in ancient cuisines including Japanese, Chinese, Greek and Roman cuisines. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs show a snow-filled vessel next to fruit juice. There are Tang dynasty records of a chilled dessert made with flour, camphor and water buffalo milk and recipes for snow-chilled sweets are included in a 1st-century Roman recipe book. There are Persian records from the 2nd century AD for sweetened chilled drinks with ice made by freezing water in the desert at night.</p>
    <p>Ice cream was made possible only by the discovery of the endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could only be chilled but not frozen. It was the addition of salt, that lowered the melting point of ice, which had the effect of drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze. The first known record of this comes from the Indian poem Pancatantra, dating to the 4th century AD. The earliest written description of the process is known not from culinary texts, but the 13th-century writings of Ibn Abu Usaybia concerning medicine. The technique of "freezing" is not known from any European sources prior to the 16th century.</p>

    <h3>South Asia</h3>
    <p>In the sixteenth century, the Mughal Empire used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to its capital Delhi. The ice was used in fruit sorbets. It was also used to create kulfi, a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent often described as "traditional Indian ice cream."</p>
    <h3>Europe</h3>
    <p>The first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in <i><font color="#900C3F">Nicholas Lemery's Recueil de curiositéz rares et nouvelles de plus </font></i> admirables effets de la nature. Recipes for sorbetti saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in François Massialot's Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits, starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.
        <b>Ice cream recipes first appeared in England in the 18th century</b> .The recipe for ice cream was published in <i> Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts</i>in London in 1718.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients and standard quality definitions:</h3>
        <p>Many countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream. In the U.S., the FDA rules state that to be described as "ice cream", a product must have the following composition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>greater than 10% milk fat</li>
            <li>6 to 10% milk and non-fat milk solids: this component, also known as the milk solids-not-fat or serum solids, contains the proteins<b>(caseins and whey proteins)</b> and carbohydrates <b>(lactose)</b> found in milk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It generally also has:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>12 to 16% sweeteners: usually a combination of sucrose and glucose-based corn syrup sweeteners</li>
        <li>0.2 to 0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers</li>
        <li>55 to 64% water, which comes from the milk or other ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant. Even the low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge contains 150 calories (630 kJ) per half-cup due to its high sugar content.</p>

            <dd>
                The origins are unclear, but it’s a shot of espresso poured over a scoop of gelato. "Affogato" means "drowned" in Italian.

                Translated from the French, it means "in the style." The French might say, "glace á la mode de Anglais," which means ice cream served in the style of the English. But in the U.S., á la mode means a dessert served with ice cream on top. It’s often pie, but may also be cake, a brownie, or a cookie.
